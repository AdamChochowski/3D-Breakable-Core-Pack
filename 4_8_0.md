### [4.08.0] – Unity 6.0.3 Compatibility  
Summary: Fixed compiler errors introduced in Unity 6.0.3 due to updated attribute validation.

Fixed  
- Resolved multiple `CS0592` errors caused by Unity 6.0.3’s stricter Roslyn compiler, which now enforces that `[SerializeField]` can only be applied to field declarations  
- Updated affected scripts to use correct serialization patterns (fields or `[field: SerializeField]` for auto-properties)  
- Ensured full compatibility with Unity 6.0.3 LTS and newer
